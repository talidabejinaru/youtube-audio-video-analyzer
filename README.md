# youtube-audio-video-analyzer
This is a Python-based script that uses the Selenium Python API to automate the process of navigating to YouTube, playing a random video and simultaneously recording both video and audio from the desktop for a maximum duration of 2 minutes. After the recording, the script analyzes the audio and logs the sound levels in decibels (dB) to a log file.
