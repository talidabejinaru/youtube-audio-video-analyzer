Steps to Set Up the Environment

1. System Information
- Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (running on VirtualBox)

$ lsb_release -a
# Output:
# No LSB modules are available.
# Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
# Description:	Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
# Release:	18.04
# Codename:	bionic


2. Python and Pip Versions
-Python was already installed on the system:

$ python3 --version
# Output: Python 3.6.9

If Python3 is not already installed, follow these steps:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3

-Pip version check and warning message

$ pip3 --version
# Output:
# WARNING: pip is being invoked by an old script wrapper. This will fail in a future version of pip.
# Please see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5599 for advice on fixing the underlying issue.
# To avoid this problem you can invoke Python with '-m pip' instead of running pip directly.
# pip 21.3.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/pip (python 3.6)

Due to the warning, I will use python3 -m pip install <package> instead of pip3 install <package> to install libraries.

If pip3 is not already installed, follow these steps:
sudo apt install python3-pip

3. Installing Required Libraries

-Selenium
python3 -m pip install selenium

-Numpy
python3 -m pip install numpy

-OpenCV
python3 -m pip install opencv-python 

-PyAudio

python3 -m pip install python3-pyaudio
